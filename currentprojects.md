The Gathering of the Juggalos is an annual music festival hosted by Psychopathic Records which spans 4 days and includes all kinds of events â€“ music, wrestling matches, poker tournaments, ninja olympics, rap battles, tattoo contests, and more. In 2014 it was held in Thornville, OH from July 23 through July 27.
</p><p>
FAMILY VALUES is a documentary film that goes behind the scenes at the 2014 Gathering to explore this often-maligned Juggalo subculture, giving voice to those previously unheard. Identity, religion and the FBI are discussed against the backdrop of the Dark Carnival.
